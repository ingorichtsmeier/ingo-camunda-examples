How to use it?
--------------

There is no web interface to access the application.
To get started refer to the `InMemoryH2Test`.

Test with spring beans in `SpringProcessTest`. 

There is also an `ArquillianTest`, which by default connects to a
Camunda BPM platform running locally on a JBoss AS 7.
You can download a Camunda BPM distribution for JBoss from the
[Camunda BPM download page](http://camunda.org/download/).


Environment Restrictions
------------------------

Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.2.2-ee.
