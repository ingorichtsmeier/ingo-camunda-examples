## How does it work?

## How to use it?
There is no web interface to access the application.
To get started refer to the `InMemoryH2Test`.

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
